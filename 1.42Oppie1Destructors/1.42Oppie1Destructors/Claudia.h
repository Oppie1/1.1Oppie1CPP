	Claudia();//This constructor runs automatically when an object is created in main. It creates a spot of memory for the object
	//to store things e.g. Functions of the object, variables, ect. Think of it like an empty box you can put tools in.

	~Claudia();//This is the destructor which runs when the program ends and objects are being destroyed. Think of it like putting
	//the tools from that box in a proper location. Perhaps a shelf in you garage.
