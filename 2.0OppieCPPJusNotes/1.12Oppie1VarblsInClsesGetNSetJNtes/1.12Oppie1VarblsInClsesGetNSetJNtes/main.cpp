//Access Specifier: "Compartments" in class that provide access (or no access) to activities/objects in main
//"public:" -> anything object in main can access whatever is in this compartment.
//"private:"-> These members (variables here) can only be accessed from functions within the class it comes
//from. Main cannot just "call" the variable (here welcomeToCodeRocks). Will get error.

//Create a class 
//Code:


	//Create a public access specifier:
	//Code:


	//Create a setter function (setName()) that takes a string parameter x. Then set that value x and set it equal to a variable that will 
	//store information from main. Make it descriptive like "welcomeStatement". It should be a void that can be called on, 
	//does action outside main, then returns control to main.
	//Code:

	//In main you will see something that "matches" this function to be filled in
	//Here we take that value that is established in main and set it equal to a variable
		//This variable acts as local storage for a sentence/strings. Here we will store the value in
		//"private". Which is just a place that keeps the information "safe" in that it can only be 
		//accessed within the class. main() cannot access this directly. I must work through another
		//function and "get" the information from private using the string getName() function we made
		//below. Programmers typically do it this way to keep an orderly flow of information. If another
		//programmer on team is working with the code in main it just controls their access to the private
		//variables. Makes code flow more orderly since the variables(attributes) may be used in other 
		//parts of a given program and you dont want to change the actual value as it may cause other 
		//issues elsewhere. 

	//Now create a getName() string function that will return a value (here whatever is stored in "welcomeStatement" 
	//variable back to main when called.
	//Code:


		//here we "get" return sentence stored in "private" to main() -> cout
		//to screen from adamsObject1 -> 'welcomeToCodeRocks!' This function purpose is to access the
		//information/here a sentence that is in private and to send it back to caller/main()
		//Important multiple objects can use this variable. When you make an object in main it is an
		//blank/empty form/box for each object -> see adamsObject2 example after adamsObject1
		//So this sentence can change accordingly


//Create a private access specifier.
//Code:


//This can only be accessed within this class "AdamClass". So main "calls" the getName() function
	//Which then runs within the class to get whatever sentence is currently stored in the variable
	//below.  Think of a variable as storage made in each object that it can use whenever but only for
	//each specific object. each object is a unique instance of the class. Again, the object is just
	//an empty form/template which contains data, functions/actions it can use. 

	//Create the string variable ("welcomeStatement") that will store sentence/string from main.
	//Code:


int main() {

	//We start with AdamClass to tell computer what template the object is being built from
	//AdamsClass -> adamsObject. adamsObject is built from the schematic/architects drawings from AdamsClass
	//So here our first empty box/form is created. It can draw from "AdamClass"

	//Create an object(object1) of the AdamClass.
	//Code:


	//Now call on that object a welcome statement/sentence/string using the setName() function with argument  which will store in the 
	//welcomeStatement variable.
	//Code:


	//Now use a cout statement and the object1 you created to retrieve the sentence stored in the string via the getName() function.
	//calls the getName() function and show to screen.
	//Code:


	//This just shows that we can create as many objects from "AdamsClass" templates as we want.
	//Can think of it like a apartment complex with each apartment being built from same footprint
	//Create a second object (object2) and display another statement/sentences/string to screen.
	//Code:
