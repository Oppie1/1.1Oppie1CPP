//Below are two examples of using a constructor to initialize members with multiple pieces of data at once.
//This allows us to reduce code in that we dont have to list each objects attributes on another line like this:


//Create a class.
//Code:


//Create a public access specifier.
//Code:



//The following are local storage variables to store info from the object. We first get he information from user which stores here
	//Then we retrieve this information oppie1Object and "." dot separator. Basically what we are saying is that oppie1Object + name
	//When we say "local" variables we are saying local to the program. Its storage space within a given function/program/class.

//Create a string variable that holds/stores a name.
//Code:


//Create an int variable that will hold an age.
	//Code:
	

	//Create a variable that will hold/store grade point average (decimal).
	//Code:



	//This constructor "template" has matching information and structure within main()
		//e.g. OppieClass1 oppieObject1("Claude", 33, 3.7) -> That information goes from there into each variable in (      )
		//programmer puts the actual information in main(). 
	//Create a constructor with string, int and double as its parameter (a, b, c) which will set the values to variables
	//where that information will be stored.
	//Code:

	
		//That information is stored in each variable and made an attribute within the class (stored in local variables)
		//This is the body of the function. The functions sole purpose is to take the data and put it into each storage box/variable. 

	
	//This is just a standard function with a void type. So main() tells it to do something and it performs that action outside 
	//main function then the program goes back to main and goes to next step.

	//Create a void function that's purpose is just to show out to screen that Claude is studying when called from main.
	//Code:


//Another example. EXACT same concepts as above.
//You can have multiple classes outside of the main program. Here is another example.

//Create a car class
//Code:


//Create a public access specifier
//Code:


//Create variables (attributes) that will store information from the constructor (age, make, model).
//Code:


//Create a CarClass constructor with parameters and set those parameters equal to the variables you just made.
//Code:	


//Create a void function that does something. Like prints out "Car hits the breaks" to the screen. 
//Code:
	

int main() {

	//This is the main program. Understand that it is connected to the classes outside the program. It is actually a function as well.
	//When I say it "calls" functions in the other classes just understand that the functions are like mini-programs the are being
	//directed to do thing from here in main.
